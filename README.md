# 🎭 Theatrebuilding.com 🌍

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **Theatrebuilding.com**! This is where the code resides for our decentralizing community of artists from around the world. 🌟

## About Theatrebuilding.com 🌐

Theatrebuilding.com is not just a website; it's an ever-evolving space where artists across the globe experiment with new ways of performing and being present.

If you grab and roll down the curtain on the homepage of theatrebuilding.com you will see an evolving series of statements. Each time a new work has been created on theatrebuilding.com, the artist or group of artists changes or adds a statement. What we do is in motion. It is an evolving expression of the energies that go into making the internet less draining, less extractive, more egalitarian, more beautiful.

## Technical Overview 🔧

- **Built with Hugo**: Our site is powered by the fast and flexible Hugo framework. Hugo is a static site generator, so we don't have a server.
- **Served on IFPS**: Our site is served on IFPS. We use Fleek.co (soon fleek.xyz) to deploy our site. If you access with Brave browser, you will have the option to access the IFPS version of the site.
- **Tina CMS**: We use Tina CMS for managing the content of the website. At the moment we are running on Tina Cloud but will eventually want to self host the back-end.
- **Low-Bandwidth Focus**: Internet speed is not equal in all parts of the world and our events and performances are meant to be seen by everyone. Therefore we have very high demands for backwards compatability and fast load times.
- **Independent**: We try to rely on as few externalas as possible and build code that lasts and can be understood by anyone with a moderate understanding of programming for the web.
- **A Performance**: A performance on theatrebuilding.com consists of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A performance is a single HTML page, in the sense that it is one URL. Any changing elements and interactivity should be written in JavaScript. There is a simple event creator and an advanced. The simple template let's you do point and click styling whereas the advanced template expects you to style everything with your own custom CSS (and javascript if needed).
